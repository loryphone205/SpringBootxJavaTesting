# SpringBootxJavaTesting
My first attempt at using Spring Boot. I've created a little demo about the connection between a DB and Java.
I've followed this Crash Course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgX5lgv4uVM

There are actuators as well to check the Application status and more.

Just like Dan Vega's video, I'm using h2 local database for testing.
I will create a better project based on MySQL.
